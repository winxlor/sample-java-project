Fetch, merge and push tryouts

First fetch, then commit local code;
Go for merge command, and then in case of conflict, resolve it and add the changed code.
Then commit it. Voila!
Finally push it to the origin or the branch in picture

git fetch upstream 
git status
vi <file_name> (Files local to the current local branch; which also includes the changes before fetching upstream)
git add --all
git commit -m "Final testing"
git merge upstream/master
Fix merge conflicts (if any)
git add --all
git commit
(Add appropriate message for the merge conflict resolution part in detail)
[master c67abdf] Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master'
git merge upstream/master
Already up-to-date. (Checking if everything went fine)
git push -u origin master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
